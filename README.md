This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to a memory location that doesn't exist. This results in a segmentation fault (crash). The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version of the code, showing how to prevent the error by checking for null pointers before dereferencing them.
